# spring-boot-docker
This project is used to containerize and deploy a Spring Boot sample application to [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) using [AWS Copilot CLI](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli).

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Java 8 or newer (full JDK not a JRE).
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Your preferred IDE 
  * Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in `Help -> About` dialog. If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/
  * [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)
  * IntelliJ IDEA
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [AWS Copilot CLI](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/releases)
* [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

### SAML configurations
This applications already has Service Provider (SP)'s private key / cert and Identity Provider (IdP)'s metadata included within this PoC (for teaching purposes).

application.yml hold the configurations ( above info, entityId, etc )

SecurityConfig.java holds the programmatic setup for SAML. ( like login url - needs to match acs.location in application.yml)

To change Identity Provider (IdP) like UCLA's IdP, replace identity-provider-certificate.crt.

To generate SP service provider key and certificate, run following command and replace private.key and public.cer:

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout private.key -out public.cer
```


## Running locally

The Spring Quickstart Guide is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/quickstart) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 8, 11 or 17):

```
git clone https://github.com/henryc/spring-boot-docker.git
cd spring-boot-docker
mvn clean package
mvn spring-boot:run
```

You can then access the spring boot application here: 
* http://localhost:8080/hello
* http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
* http://localhost:8080/detail (for SSO sign-in process)
* http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/samlexample (for downloading SP metadata)


## Building and tagging the Container

```
docker build -t springio/spring-boot-docker .
```
## Running the Container

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 springio/spring-boot-docker
```

## Other useful Docker commands

```
# List all the locally stored docker images
docker images
# List all the containers
docker ps
# Stop a running container
docker stop <container_id or container_name>
# Remove a stopped container
docker rmi <image_id>
```

## Dockerizing the sample spring boot app using Dockerfile

```
FROM public.ecr.aws/docker/library/maven:3.8.5-amazoncorretto-8 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package

FROM public.ecr.aws/docker/library/amazoncorretto:8u332-alpine3.15-jre
RUN addgroup -S spring && adduser -S spring -G spring
USER spring:spring
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY --chown=spring:spring --from=builder /app/${JAR_FILE} spring-boot-docker-demo.jar
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/ || exit 1
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/spring-boot-docker-demo.jar"]
```

## Deploying the container on existing infrastructure with AWS Copilot CLI to AWS Fargate

1. Create a new application with an existing domain name in Amazon Route53 using [copilot app init](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/app-init/) command.
```
copilot app init --domain <domain_name>
``` 

2. Create new application using [copilot init](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/init/) command.
```
copilot init
```
**NOTE:** When prompted if you would like to deploy a test environment? Enter **N**. So that you can specify your own existing VPC resources using [copilot env init](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/env-init/) command.

3. Creates a test environment with imported VPC resources
```
copilot env init --name test --profile default --app <app-name> --import-vpc-id <vpc-id> \
--import-public-subnets <public-subnet-id-a, public-subnet-id-b> \
--import-private-subnets <private-subnet-id-a, private-subnet-id-b>
``` 

**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying the service update the copilot/your-service-name/manifest.yml file to include the correct path to the [load balanced web service](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/manifest/lb-web-service/) healthcheck as shown below:
```
path: '/actuator/health/'
```
By default, AWS Fargate cluster tasks are hosted in public subnets. However, If you want to place them into your private subnets, add the following to the manifest.yml file:
```
network:
  vpc:
    placement: 'private'
```
4. Deploys the service using [copilot deploy](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/deploy/) command
```
copilot deploy
```
Once the service is deployed, you can access the sample service at your ALB over the internet.

**IMPORTANT:** Before copilot deploy, uncomment acs.location for AWS env (one with https) in application.yml

5. Verify the service endpoints using cURL command. You should get similar output as follows:
```
$ curl -X GET ALB/actuator/health
{"status":"UP"}
$ curl -X GET ALB/hello
Hello World!
$ curl -X GET ALB/hello?name=Docker
Hello Docker!
```
**HINT:** Append the service endpoint to the ALB.

6. Verify SSO login process (in browser) with following link

```
local: http://localhost:8080/detail
remote: ALB/detail
```
*Note: for AWS environments, please get metadata from ALB/saml2/service-provider-metadata/samlexample
and upload to https://samltest.id/upload.php before testing

7. To clean up and delete all resources associated with the application use [copilot app delete](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/commands/app-delete/) command.
```
copilot app delete
```

## Create CodePipline using AWS Copilot CLI (Deploy after application deployment)

1.Generate CodeBuild and CodePipeline configurations (modify prompts if necessary)
```
copilot pipeline init
```
This will generate manifest.yml (CodePipeline) and buildspec.yml (CodeBuild)

**NOTE:** This manifest.yml file is a different file. Do not confuse this with manifest.yaml from copilot init step.

2. Commit /copilot folder to the repo.

3. Setup Codepipeline
```
copilot pipeline deploy
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections to complete Github connection.  Make sure to select EXISTING CodeStar connection and NOT installing the app into github again. Otherwise this will break all other connections for all accounts (organization-wide)

4. At this point Codepipeline should be setup.  Commit new code to repo and see Codepipeline deploy changes Fargate (new fargate task will be created)
